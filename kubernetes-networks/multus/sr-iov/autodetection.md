# sr-iov - Autodetection 

Yes, it‚Äôs technically possible to **autodetect SR-IOV NICs** on a Kubernetes node and dynamically configure a **Multus `NetworkAttachmentDefinition`** to attach a pod to a randomly selected one ‚Äî **but not entirely natively** or dynamically at runtime without help.

### Let's break it down:

---

### üîç SR-IOV Interface Detection

You can detect all SR-IOV capable NICs on a node using tools like:

```bash
lspci | grep -i ether
```

Or more specifically:

```bash
ls /sys/class/net | while read iface; do
  if [ -d "/sys/class/net/$iface/device/sriov_totalvfs" ]; then
    echo "$iface is SR-IOV capable"
  fi
done
```

The `sriov-device-plugin` used with Kubernetes typically discovers and advertises these VFs to the Kubelet.

---

### üì¶ Multus + SR-IOV

Multus uses `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) with SR-IOV by referencing a resource (like `intel.com/sriov_netdevice`). This ties into the `sriov-network-device-plugin`, which assigns Virtual Functions (VFs) to pods based on availability.

But **you can't directly say "randomly pick an SR-IOV interface" in the NAD JSON**. It needs a defined resource name and configuration ‚Äî unless you automate generating NADs.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è So how do you make this dynamic?

#### Option 1: Dynamic NAD Generator (Custom Controller or Admission Webhook)
- Create a custom mutating webhook or initContainer that:
  - Detects all available SR-IOV devices on the node.
  - Randomly picks one.
  - Generates a NAD dynamically (with unique name) or patches the pod spec to refer to the chosen one.

#### Option 2: Predefine Multiple NADs
- Define multiple NADs manually, each bound to a specific SR-IOV interface.
- In your app logic or scheduling controller, randomly select one when creating the pod.

#### Option 3: Use SR-IOV device plugin with resource pool
- Let the `sriov-network-operator` manage pools (e.g., via `SriovNetworkNodePolicy`) and abstract the devices.
- Pods just request a resource (e.g., `intel.com/sriov_netdevice`) and the device plugin picks from the available pool.

This is not *truly random per pod*, but it‚Äôs **automatically distributed** if you're okay with that.

---

### ‚úÖ TL;DR

- **Auto-detecting SR-IOV NICs** = easy via sysfs or `sriov-network-device-plugin`.
- **Random assignment in Multus NAD** = not directly supported.
- **Solutions**:
  - Use device plugin + pool (simpler).
  - Generate NADs dynamically via custom logic (more flexible).

---

Perfect ‚Äî you're aiming for **random selection of a specific SR-IOV VF per pod**, which is a bit outside of what Multus and the SR-IOV device plugin do by default. But with a bit of Kubernetes magic, we can make it work.

Here‚Äôs a practical **design pattern** to achieve this:

---

## üß© Strategy for Random SR-IOV NIC Selection Per Pod

### 1. **Predefine NADs for Each SR-IOV Interface**
- You create one `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` per physical interface (e.g., `sriov-net-ens1f0`, `sriov-net-ens2f0`, etc.)
- Each NAD refers to a specific `resourceName` exposed by the SR-IOV device plugin.

#### Example NAD for `ens1f0`:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: sriov-net-ens1f0
spec:
  config: '{
    "type": "sriov",
    "name": "sriov-net-ens1f0",
    "ipam": {
      "type": "static"
    },
    "deviceID": "0000:01:00.1"  # optional if resource pool used
  }'
```

---

### 2. **Custom Init Container or Admission Webhook to Inject a Random NAD**

Since Kubernetes doesn't support "pick a random NAD" natively, your workaround is:

#### Option A: Init Container + Downward API + Host Mount
1. Mount a host path (e.g., `/etc/cni/net.d`) into the pod as read-only.
2. Have an **init container** (or even an entrypoint script) that:
   - Lists available NADs (e.g., via Kubernetes API).
   - Picks one at random.
   - Patches the pod's annotations to include it (if running in privileged mode + with necessary permissions).
   - Or writes the choice to an environment file used by the main container.

#### Option B: Mutating Admission Webhook
This is more elegant but more complex:
- Write a small webhook service (e.g., in Go or Python) that intercepts Pod creation.
- At admission time, it:
  - Queries available NADs matching a pattern (e.g., label or name prefix).
  - Picks one at random.
  - Adds the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks` annotation with the chosen NAD.

üëâ This works seamlessly and is transparent to your apps.

---

### 3. **Deploy Your Pods With a Generic NAD Label**
You only need to request something like this:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-net-<RANDOM>
```

The actual `<RANDOM>` part gets injected by your webhook or entrypoint logic.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools You‚Äôll Need
- Kubernetes client (kubectl or client library)
- Permissions to list NADs (CRD)
- Optional: controller/webhook framework like Kubebuilder or Kopf (Python)
- Custom script or binary to pick the NAD at runtime

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- Full control and randomness
- Works even with static SR-IOV assignments
- Extensible for other policies (e.g., "least used")

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats
- You'll need a controller/webhook or privileged init logic.
- NADs must be kept in sync with actual node hardware and VF pools.
- If you‚Äôre using the `sriov-network-operator`, you may have to manually break up your `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` into per-interface pools.

Want a ready-made Python or Bash script to randomly pick a NAD and patch the pod? Or a small webhook template in Go/Python?



Awesome! Here's a **ready-made Bash script** that randomly selects a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` (NAD) from a specific namespace and outputs it in a way your Pod or init container can use.

---

### ‚úÖ What this script does:
- Lists all NADs in a namespace (with optional prefix filter).
- Randomly picks one.
- Writes it to a file or echoes it (depending on how you want to use it).

---

### üìÑ `pick-random-nad.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES
NAMESPACE="${NAD_NAMESPACE:-default}"        # Namespace where NADs are defined
PREFIX="${NAD_PREFIX:-sriov-net-}"           # Filter NADs with a certain prefix
OUTPUT_FILE="${OUTPUT_FILE:-/tmp/selected_nad}"  # File to store result

# REQUIRE: kubectl installed and available in container
if ! command -v kubectl &> /dev/null; then
    echo "kubectl not found in PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Fetch list of matching NADs
NADS=$(kubectl get network-attachment-definitions -n "$NAMESPACE" -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}" | tr ' ' '\n' | grep "^${PREFIX}")

# Check if we found anything
if [ -z "$NADS" ]; then
    echo "No NADs found in namespace '$NAMESPACE' with prefix '$PREFIX'"
    exit 1
fi

# Pick one at random
SELECTED_NAD=$(echo "$NADS" | shuf -n1)

echo "Selected NAD: $SELECTED_NAD"

# Save to file or stdout
echo "$SELECTED_NAD" > "$OUTPUT_FILE"
```

### üß™ Example Usage in an Init Container (conceptual)

```yaml
initContainers:
  - name: pick-nad
    image: bitnami/kubectl:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
    args:
      - |
        chmod +x /scripts/pick-random-nad.sh
        /scripts/pick-random-nad.sh
    env:
      - name: NAD_NAMESPACE
        value: "default"
      - name: NAD_PREFIX
        value: "sriov-net-"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: scripts
        mountPath: /scripts
      - name: shared
        mountPath: /nad

containers:
  - name: main-app
    image: your-app
    env:
      - name: NAD_NAME
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: nad-config
            key: selected_nad  # Or mount shared volume if using file
    volumeMounts:
      - name: shared
        mountPath: /nad
volumes:
  - name: scripts
    configMap:
      name: pick-nad-script
  - name: shared
    emptyDir: {}
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Permissions Needed
Your service account (or init container) needs permission to:

```yaml
apiGroups: ["k8s.cni.cncf.io"]
resources: ["network-attachment-definitions"]
verbs: ["list"]
```

---

Want a variant that **patches the Pod spec on-the-fly** to inject the selected NAD annotation?
