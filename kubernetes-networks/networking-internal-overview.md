### General 

  * Each pod will have its own network namespace
    * with routing, networkdevices 
  * Connection to default namespace to host is done through veth - Link to bridge on host network 
    * similar like on docker to docker0 
  
```
  Each container is connected to the bridge via a veth-pair. This interface pair functions like a virtual point-to-point ethernet connection and connects the network namespaces of the containers with the network namespace of the host
```
  
  * Every container is in the same Network Namespace, so they can communicate through localhost
    * Example with hashicorp/http-echo container 1 and busybox container 2 
 
 
## Pod-To-Pod Communication (across nodes)  
 
### Prerequisites 
 
  * pods on a single node as well as pods on a topological remote can establish communication at all times
   * Each pod receives a unique IP address, valid anywhere in the cluster. Kubernetes requires this address to not be subject to network address   translation (NAT)
   * Pods on the same node through virtual bridge (see image above)
 
### General (what needs to be done) - and could be doen manually
 
   * local bridge networks of all nodes need to be connected
   * there needs to be an IPAM (IP-Address Managemenet) so addresses are only used once
   * The need to be routes so, that each bridge can communicate with the bridge on the other network
   * Plus: There needs to be a rule for incoming network
   * Also: A tunnel needs to be set up to the outside world.

### General - Pod-to-Pod Communiation (across nodes) - what would need to be done

### General - Pod-to-Pod Communication (side-note) 

  * This could of cause be done manually, but it is too complex 
  * So Kubernetes has created an Interface, which is well defined 
    * The interface is called CNI (common network interface) 
    * Funtionally is achieved through Network Plugin (which use this interface) 
      * e.g. calico / cilium / weave net / flannel 


### CNI 

  * CNI only handles network connectivity of container and the cleanup of allocated resources (i.e. IP addresses) after containers have been deleted (garbage collection) and therefore is lightweight and quite easy to implement. 
  * There are some basic libraries within CNI which do some basic stuff.
 
   
    


## Hidden Pause Container 

### What is for ? 

  * Holds the network - namespace for the pod 
  * Gets started first and falls asleep later 
  * Will still be there, when the other containers die 

```
cd 
mkdir -p manifests 
cd manifests 
mkdir pausetest
cd pausetest
nano 01-nginx.yml
```

```
# vi nginx-static.yml 

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pausetest
  labels:
    webserver: nginx:1.21
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web
    image: nginx
```

```
kubectl apply -f .
# als root auf dem worker node 
ctr -n k8s.io c list | grep pause
```
