# veth and iptables ....

## Explanation 

> **When a packet goes from one end of a veth pair to the other — does *that* action trigger iptables rules?**

👉 **Answer:** **No**, the *act* of a packet traveling **through the veth pair itself** (from one end to the other) does **not** hit iptables directly.

---

### 🔍 Think of it like this:

The `veth` pair is just a **pipe** between two network interfaces.

- When the pod sends a packet, it hits the **pod's `eth0`** (which is a veth interface).
- That packet is instantly transferred to the **peer interface** on the host (also a veth).
- That **transfer itself** — the jump between the veth ends — is **not processed by iptables**.

---

### 🧱 iptables only comes in when:
- The **host kernel processes the packet**, e.g., routing, forwarding, delivering to an application.
- The packet is being **routed** or **bridged**, or undergoes **NAT**, etc.

---

### 📷 Visualization:

```text
Pod eth0 (vethX)  <=====>  vethY on host  → bridge (cni0) → rest of the network

             [no iptables]       →        [iptables here]
```

---

So to summarize:

✅ **iptables is involved** when the **packet leaves the veth** and is handled by the host stack (e.g., routed, forwarded, NATed).  
❌ **iptables is not involved** in the **link between the two ends** of the veth — that part is a simple packet transfer.

Let me know if you want to trace the path of a packet from a pod to another pod or the internet — happy to diagram it!
