# Benefits of a service mesh

## What is a service mesh ?

```
A service mesh is an infrastructure layer
that gives applications capabilities
like zero-trust security, observability,
and advanced traffic management, without code changes.
```

## Advantages / Features 

 1. Observability & monitoring
 1. Traffic management
 1. Resilience & Reliability 
 1. Security
 1. Service Discovery

### Observability & monitoring

  * Service mesh offers:
    * valuable insights into the communication between services
    * effective monitoring to help in troubleshooting application errors.

### Traffic management

  * Service mesh offers:
    * intelligent request distribution
    * load balancing, 
    * support for canary deployments. 
    * These capabilities enhance resource utilization and enable efficient traffic management

### Resilience & Reliability 

  * By handling retries, timeouts, and failures,
    * service mesh contributes to the overall stability and resilience of services
    * reducing the impact of potential disruptions.

### Security

  * Service mesh enforces security policies, and handles authentication, authorization, and encryption
    * ensuring secure communication between services and eventually, strengthening the overall security posture of the application.

### Service Discovery

  * With service discovery features, service mesh can simplify the process of locating and routing services dynamically
  * adapting to system changes seamlessly. This enables easier management and interaction between services.

## Overall benefits 

```
Microservices communication:
Adopting a service mesh can simplify the implementation of a microservices architecture by abstracting away infrastructure complexities.
It provides a standardized approach to manage and orchestrate communication within the microservices ecosystem.
