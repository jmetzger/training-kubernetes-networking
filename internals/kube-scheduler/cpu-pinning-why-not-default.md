# Why is CPU-Pinning not used by default ?

## The basics 

CPU pinning (or **CPU affinity**) is a technique where specific processes or threads are bound to run on specific CPUs (cores), rather than being scheduled on any available CPU by the OS scheduler. This can improve **performance and cache locality** by keeping workloads on the same CPU and reducing context switching or cache misses.

---

### 🔧 How CPU Pinning Works

When CPU pinning is enabled:

- The OS scheduler is told to **restrict** a process/thread to a specific CPU (or a set of CPUs).
- For example: process A → only runs on CPU 0, process B → only on CPU 1.
- In Linux, tools like `taskset`, `cset`, or `cpuset cgroups` can enforce CPU pinning.
- In containers, it's handled via cgroups and `cpuset` settings, often via the container runtime or orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

---

### 🤔 Why Was CPU Pinning Used?

- **Real-time systems**: where latency and predictability are critical.
- **Performance tuning**: for applications that are CPU-bound and benefit from avoiding cache thrashing or migration.
- **NUMA-aware scheduling**: pinning threads to specific NUMA nodes can help optimize memory access patterns.

### 🧊 Why Kubernetes Doesn't Use CPU Pinning by Default Anymore

Kubernetes used to support pinning via the `cpuManagerPolicy=static`, which could align containers to specific cores when `Guaranteed` QoS was used.

However, **it's not the default**, and here's why:

1. **Complexity vs. Benefit**:
   - Managing CPU topology at scale is **complex and brittle**.
   - In dynamic workloads (which Kubernetes excels at), strict pinning can lead to **resource fragmentation** and underutilization.

2. **Reduced Flexibility**:
   - Pinning reduces the OS scheduler’s ability to optimize CPU time across workloads.
   - It limits Kubernetes' ability to reschedule or balance pods dynamically.

3. **Overhead in Mixed Workloads**:
   - For non-latency-critical workloads, the gains are often negligible.
   - Kubernetes prefers **isolation** via cgroups (`cpu shares`, `quota`, etc.), which is more flexible.

4. **Not Portable**:
   - CPU pinning is **highly node-specific**.
   - Kubernetes prioritizes portability, so default behavior avoids assuming specific CPU layouts.

### 🛠️ When You *Should* Use CPU Pinning in Kubernetes

CPU pinning *is* still possible in Kubernetes with the right settings:

- Use `Guaranteed` QoS class (i.e., requests = limits for CPU).
- Enable `--cpu-manager-policy=static` on the kubelet.
- Optionally configure `TopologyManager` and `NUMA` alignment.

✅ Recommended for:
- Real-time or latency-sensitive apps (e.g., telco 5G workloads)
- HPC (high-performance computing)
- Some AI/ML inference workloads

Let’s break that down — it's a key point in understanding *why* Kubernetes doesn’t use strict CPU pinning by default.

---

### 🔄 What are Dynamic Workloads?

In Kubernetes, **dynamic workloads** means:

- Pods **come and go frequently** (auto-scaling, job runners, CI/CD pipelines, etc.).
- Cluster **resources are shared** among many teams or services.
- Kubernetes constantly tries to **optimize usage**: bin-packing, rescheduling, scaling up/down.

---

### 📌 What Does “Strict CPU Pinning” Do?

Strict CPU pinning means:

- A container gets locked to **specific CPU cores**.
- Those cores are reserved **exclusively** for that pod — no sharing.
- Even if the pod is doing **nothing**, no one else can use those cores.

---

### 🧩 Now: What is Resource Fragmentation?

Imagine you have a 4-core node:

| Core | Available? | Pinned to |
|------|------------|-----------|
| 0    | No         | Pod A     |
| 1    | No         | Pod B     |
| 2    | Yes        | Free      |
| 3    | Yes        | Free      |

Now another pod (Pod C) comes in and wants 2 CPUs — but **only 2 unpinned cores are available**.

✅ Kubernetes sees 2 free CPUs overall  
🚫 But because cores 0 & 1 are pinned (and not shared), Pod C **can’t be scheduled here**, even though the node is only 50% utilized!

That’s **resource fragmentation**: the **available CPU is split into unusable chunks**.

---

### 📉 What is Underutilization?

Same scenario:  
Let’s say Pod A and Pod B are mostly idle — using only ~5% CPU each.

But because they’ve *pinned* their CPUs, no other pod is allowed to use cores 0 or 1.

Result?

- Cores 0 and 1 are **mostly idle**.
- The node looks **"full"** to the scheduler.
- Meanwhile, other nodes may be **overloaded**.

That's **underutilization** — you’re **not getting the most out of your hardware**.

---

### ⚖️ Why Kubernetes Avoids This

Kubernetes prefers **soft isolation** via cgroups:

- Containers get CPU *shares* or *quotas*, not full core reservations.
- The OS can dynamically move workloads around.
- Kubernetes can fit more workloads per node and reschedule things efficiently.

So unless you're in a **real-time** or **deterministic** use case (like telco or industrial systems), strict pinning hurts the **efficiency and elasticity** that Kubernetes is designed for.
